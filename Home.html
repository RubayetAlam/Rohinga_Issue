        <p>This  Rohingya  refugee  crisis  is  among  the  largest,fastest  movements  of  people  in  recent  history.   SinceAugust 25, 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya refugeesfrom   Myanmar   have   fled   to   Bangladesh.TheRohingya,   a  mostly  Muslim  minority  ethnic  groupin  predominantly  Buddhist  Myanmar,   are  escapingwhat  the  United  Nations  has  described  as  genocidalviolence that follows decades of persecution and humanrights  abuses.    Flooding  into  Coxs  Bazar  district  inBangladesh,  the  refugees  joined  more  than  200,000Rohingya  who  fled  years  before.Today,  about  880,000stateless  Rohingya  refugees  live  in  the  worlds  largestand most densely populated refugee camp, Kutupalong.About  half  of  the  refugees  are  children.    On  March22,  2021,  their  plight  intensified  after  a  massive  fireswept through Coxs Bazar, destroying more than 10,000shelters,  food  distribution  sites,  and  clean  water  andsanitation facilities.  The deadly blaze ripped throughfour of the 34 camps,  displacing about 45,000 people.The death toll has risen to at least 15, with another 560injured and over 400 missing, according to preliminaryestimates  by  the  Inter-Sector  Coordination  Group,  acentral  coordinating  team  for  humanitarian  agenciesserving Rohingya refugees in Coxs Bazar</p>

        <p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,the  Office  of  the  (UNHCR),  was  established  on  Dec.14, 1950 by the General Assembly which is also known as  The  UN  Refugee  Agency.   Since  its  establishmenttill now the UNHCR is one of the specialized organs ofthe United Nations which deals with the refugee issues.It  seeks  permanent  solutions  to  the  refugee  problems,offers international protection to refugees,  coordinatesthe activities of voluntary agencies, and assists the mostneedy  refugee  groups,  particularly,  in  their  voluntaryrepatriation, local integration or resettlement to a thirdcountry. The UNHCR is a voluntary organization of theUnited Nations that works all over the world.  3 In July1951,  a  diplomatic  conference  in  Geneva  adopted  theConvention relating to the Status of Refugees ,  whichwas  later  amended  by  the  1967  Protocol.   The  1951Convention  Relating  to  the  Status  of  Refugees  is  thekey legal document in defining who are termed as therefugees,  their  rights  and  legal  obligations  of  states.5Initially, the 1951 Convention was more or less limitedto   protecting   European   refugees   in   the   aftermathof  World  War  II,  but  the  1967  Protocol  expandedits  scope  as  the  problem  of  population  displacementspread around the world.6 The 1967 Protocol removedthe  geographical  and  temporal  restrictions  from  theconvention.The  1951  Convention  Relating  to  theStatus  of  Refugees  and  its  1967  Protocol  has  becomethe  preliminary  instruments  in  the  development  ofinternational  refugee  law.   At  present,  there  are  148countries   that   subscribe   to   one   or   both   of   theseinstruments,  expressing a worldwide consensus on thedefinition  of  the  terms  refugee  and  the  fundamentalrights  to  be  granted  to  the  refugees.8  According  tothe  1951  Refugee  Convention,  a  refugee  is  defined  as a  person  who:  Owing  to  a  well-founded  fear  of  beingpersecuted  for  reasons  of  race,  religion,  nationality,membership  of  a  particular  social  group  or  politicalopinion,  is  outside  the  country  of  his  nationality,  andis  unable  to  or,  owing  to  such  fear,  is  unwilling  toavail  himself  of  the  protection  of  that  country  or  toreturn there because there is a fear of persecution.  Thereasons of persecution must be one of the five groundslisted  in  article  of  the  Refugee  Convention,  namely:race,  religion,  nationality,  membership  of  a  particularsocial group or political opinion.  Persecution based onany other ground will not be considered as this is thelimitation of the definition.  Lately, it has been observedthat  other  numerous  reasons  cause  or,  to  be  exact,force the person to flee due to the existence of criticalsituational  circumstances,  such  as,  civil  war,  naturaldisaster,  unmitigibable  poverty,  mass  unemploymentand  multifarious  other  causes  which  need  additionalinclusion under the definition of a refugee.10 Accordingto the definition, certain person will not get the statusof refugees if he/she- a) has a record to commit a crimeagainst  humanity  or  any  other  crime  defined  underinternational  instruments;  b)  has  committed  a  non-political crime;  c) or has connectivity or allegation tocommit any other crime which is contradictory with theprovision of the United Nations.</p>
            
            <p>Children also face risks of malnutrition, trafficking, and getting sick with COVID-19 or other illnesses, as water and sanitation sites have been damaged or destroyed</p>
            <p>“Rohingya refugees are among the most vulnerable people in the world. They have been living with ongoing uncertainty, storms, and the threat of disease outbreaks since fleeing their homes in 2017. This fire is the last thing that they need at a time when shelter is critical for protection from the impending monsoon season and COVID-19 is threatening to circulate around the crowded camps at an alarming rate,” says Fredrick Christopher, Rohingya crisis response director for World Vision in Bangladesh.</p>
            <p>An unforgiving incident like this just deepens the sense of hopelessness in the hearts of everyone here at Cox’s Bazar. World Vision will spare no effort in continuing to mobilize all our resources to help the Rohingya children and families during this extraordinarily challenging time,” he says.</p>
